This project implements a TCP server-client architecture using the TFTP protocol, with an emphasis on the server side.
It features a robust encoder and decoder that adhere to the predefined TFTP conversation rules.
The server is designed to efficiently process and respond to client messages, including breaking down responses into packets for transmission.
Connection handlers are employed to manage communications effectively.
